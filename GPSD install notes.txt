Install GPSD
You can always just read that raw data, but its much nicer if you can have some Linux software prettify it. We'll try out gpsd which is a GPS-handling Daemon (background-helper)

To install gpsd, make sure your Pi has an Internet connection and run the following commands from the console: 

 sudo apt-get install gpsd gpsd-clients python-gps 
Raspbian Jessie systemd service fix

Note if you're using the Raspbian Jessie or later release you'll need to disable a systemd service that gpsd installs.  This service has systemd listen on a local socket and run gpsd when clients connect to it, however it will also interfere with other gpsd instances that are manually run (like in this guide).  You will need to disable the gpsd systemd service by running the following commands:

 sudo systemctl stop gpsd.socket
 sudo systemctl disable gpsd.socket
Should you ever want to enable the default gpsd systemd service you can run these commands to restore it (but remember the rest of the steps in this guide won't work!):

 sudo systemctl enable gpsd.socket
 sudo systemctl start gpsd.socket

sudo apt-get install setserial
